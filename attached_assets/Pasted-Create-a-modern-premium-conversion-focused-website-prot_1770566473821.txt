Create a modern, premium, conversion-focused website prototype for a pizza and pasta brand.

The atmosphere must feel warm, rustic, handcrafted, welcoming, and elevated.
Design for emotional impact, appetite stimulation, and strong calls to action.

Use cinematic food imagery, cozy kitchen moods, flour textures, soft shadows, and depth.

🎨 Color System

Use consistently in UI, accents, backgrounds, and interaction states.

Primary: Burnt Orange #D35400

Secondary: Olive Green #556B2F

Accent: Wheat #F5DEB3

Dark: Espresso Brown #3E2723

Light: Linen #FBF6EE

Avoid flat design. Add gradients, warm overlays, subtle grain, and realistic lighting.
